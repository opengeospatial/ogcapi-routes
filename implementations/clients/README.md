# Using OGC API Features

This folder contains descriptions how GIS clients and libraries can be used to connect to APIs that implement OGC API Routes. The focus is on examples and "how-to" descriptions that help others to use the software to connect to such APIs.

We welcome pull requests to update this page to add or update an entry for a client implementation that can be used to connect to APIs implementing OGC API Routes. If it is your software product, please also update the [main page](../README.adoc).
