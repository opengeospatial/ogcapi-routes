# Publishing APIs implementing OGC API Routes

This folder contains descriptions of software packages that can be used to provide APIs that implement and conform to OGC API Routes. The focus is on examples and "how-to" descriptions.

We welcome pull requests to update this page to add or update an entry for a server implementation. If it is your software product, please also update the [main page](../README.adoc).
