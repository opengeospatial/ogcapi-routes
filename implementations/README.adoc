# Implementations

#work-in-progress#

This page lists software packages that implement approved or draft OGC API Routes standards. Draft standards are only added once they have a tagged version. Currently the following are covered:

* http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-000.html[OGC API - Routes - Part 1: Core 1.0 (DRAFT)]
* http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-001.html[OGC Route Exchange Model 1.0 (DRAFT)]

Two types of software packages are distinguished:

* Server implementations are software products that can be used to set up APIs that implement conformance classes.
* Client implementations are software products that connect to APIs implementing conformance classes to use the feature data.


## Contribute

If you have a server or client implementation of OGC API Routes, we welcome a pull request to update this page to add or update an entry for the product. You may add a link to a sub-page with more details in the link:servers[servers] and link:clients[clients] folders of this repository and you may add a link to the associated entry in the OGC Product Database. Please include a contact email address so that we may later contact you in case of page updates or questions.

If you have a server product, please consider to https://www.ogc.org/resource/products/registration[register it in the OGC Product Database] and https://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine/[test it for compliance], too.

## Servers

The columns for each part list the conformance classes of the standard that are implemented by the server implementation.

## Clients

The columns for each part list the conformance classes of the standard that the client uses when connecting to an API and the API supports that conformance class.
