== Scope

The OGC API - Routes - Part 1: Core Standard specifies the behavior of a Web API that allows applications to request routes in a manner independent of the underlying routing data set, routing engine or algorithm. 

This standard defines modular API building blocks to: 

* Compute new routes,
* Specify additional, commonly used routing parameters in addition to the start and end point of the route,
* Manage routes on the server.

Routes are represented as a feature collection encoded in GeoJSON according to the <<REM,OGC Route Exchange Model>>.

In addition, the API supports building blocks that enable clients to interrogate the API and retrieve the API definition, and a list of conformance classes supported by the API.
