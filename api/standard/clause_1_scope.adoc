== Scope

OGC API - Routes - Part 1: Core Standard specifies the behavior of a Web API that allows applications to request routes in a manner independent of the underlying routing data set, routing engine or algorithm. 

This standard defines modular API building blocks to: 

* Compute new routes,
* Specify additional, commonly used routing parameters in addition to the start and end point of the route,
* Manage routes on the server.

Routes are represented as a GeoJSON encoded feature collection according to the OGC Route Exchange Model.

In addition, the API supports building blocks that enable clients to interrogate the API and retrieve the API definition, and a list of conformance classes supported by the API.
