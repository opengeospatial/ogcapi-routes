== Requirements for Web-based Routing

This section describes the requirements that this standard supports.

The bare minimum requirement for a Routing API is to compute a route based on a start and end point. The resulting route is encoded using the Route Exchange Model (REM).

Besides this basic requirement, additional optional requirements to the API are:

* Storage and management of computed routes

Additionally, a Routing API may support the following optional routing parameters:

* Capability to add additional intermediate waypoints.
* Select a transport mode for the route computation.
* Apply a height restriction to the route computation.
* Apply a weight restriction to the route computation.
* Ability to define obstacles that have to be avoided.
* Specify departure or arrival times.
