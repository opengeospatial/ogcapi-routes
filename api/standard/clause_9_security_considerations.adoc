== Security considerations

The general Security Considerations for Web APIs are also applicable to the Routing API. For example, see the link:http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0#_security_considerations[Security Considerations section] in OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core.

The following is a list of topics to be considered by implementers of the OGC Routing API:

* Fetching the list of routes (GET `/routes`) returns information about all routes on the server. In any operational, public deployment every user should probably only see their routes plus routes that others have shared with the user.
* The same applies to access to each route (GET `/route/{routeId}`) and their definition (GET `/route/{routeId}/definition`) as well as to the capability to cancel or delete a route (DELETE `/route/{routeId}`).

That is, any deployment that is not restricted to a closed group of users will typically require user accounts, access control to the API operations and a capability for sharing routes with the public or other users.
