[big]*i.     Abstract*

<<OGCAPI,OGC API standards>> define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

The OGC API family of standards is organized by resource type. 

The OGC API - Routes - Part 1: Core standard specifies the fundamental API building blocks for interacting with the routes resource type. Routing is one of the most widely used geospatial operations in the world today.
 
This standard uses the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-001.html[Route Exchange Model] to represent routes.
 
For providers of routes, the API building blocks and the Route Exchange Model provide a simple model to publish and offer those routes as resources for use by other systems.
 
For developers building infrastructures, the API building blocks provide a thin abstraction layer to leverage existing routing engines and algorithms using modern APIs - saving development and deployment time and costs.
 
For users, applications, and enterprises, the capability to get routes across a common API, regardless of the underlying routing data, engines, or algorithms, represents a significant step forward in geospatial interoperability.
 
Finally, the OGC recognizes that there are many environments for implementing open routing including on road, off road, air, sea, and many others. In addition, some communities may require specialized parameters in their Routing API.
 
Accordingly, the OGC API - Routes - Part 1: Core accepts two waypoints, a start and end position, which may be in different environments, return paths and waypoints between those positions, and be extensible to support parameters required by diverse implementation communities.
