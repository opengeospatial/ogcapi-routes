== Routing API

=== Overview

This clause specifies the API building blocks for a Web API for Routing based on the <<OGCWebAPIGuidelines,OGC Web API Guidelines>>, <<CommonCore,OGC API Common>> and the <<REM,OGC Route Exchange Model>>. The API building blocks are specified in the following requirements/conformance classes:

* Minimal routing capability:
** **Core**: Routing based on start/end point.
* Additional API capabilities:
** **Manage routes**: Store, fetch and delete routes stored on the server.
* Additional routing parameters:
** **Mode**: Specify the type of transport when computing the route.
** **Intermediate waypoints**: Pass through additional points along the route.
** **Height restrictions**: Consider a specified vehicle height in meters against known height restrictions when computing the route.
** **Weight restrictions**: Consider a specified vehicle weight in metric tons (tonnes) against known weight restrictions when computing the route.
** **Obstacles**: Avoid obstacles.
** **Temporal constraints**: Specify departure/arrival time.

The API building blocks support the resources and operations listed in Table 1.

The first three operations are available in the 'Core' requirements class.  All routing
APIs implementing this Standard will support them. The other four operations are implemented by routing APIs implementing the
'Manage routes' requirements class.

==== OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core

At the time of writing, <<CommonCore,OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core>> has been voted on, but is not yet published. The requirements classes "Core", "Landing Page" and "JSON" have to be supported. This includes support for the resources Landing Page, Conformance Declaration and API Definition. Support for the "HTML" and "OpenAPI 3.0" requirements classes is recommended.

NOTE: Version 1.0 of this Standard will either reference a published version of the OGC API - Common - Part 1: Standard or directly include the relevant provisions from the requirements classes "Core", "Landing Page" and "JSON".

The following is an example of a landing page of a routing API that implements this Standard.

[[conformance_declaration]]
==== Declaration of conformance classes

The following is an example of the conformance declaration of a routing API that implements all requirements classes specified in this Standard.

Requirements classes can support options and parsing the API definition may be unnecessarily costly for clients to determine the options. The conformance declaration, therefore, is extended to support stating the options of a conformance class in a `properties` member where the conformance class URI is the key for the options of that conformance class.

  }
}

=================

[[geometries]]
==== Geometries

All implementations of this Standard will support geometries encoded as GeoJSON. This includes the waypoints in the route definition and the geometries of all features in the route exchange model (overview, start, end, segments).

All geometries use coordinates based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) datum, i.e., the coordinate reference system (CRS) used by Global Positioning System (GPS). In GeoJSON, a coordinate is an array of numbers. The first two elements are longitude and latitude, or easting and northing, precisely in that order and specified in decimal numbers. Ellipsoidal height may be included as an optional third element.

Support for additional encodings or additional CRSs may be specified in future extensions.

[[routes]]
==== Routes

[[compute_route]]
===== Compute a new route

This operation creates a new route. The payload of the request specifies the definition of the new route.

The core requirements class supports a minimum route definition by using two `waypoints`: The start and end point of the route.

In addition, clients can select a cost function, as the routing `preference`. The API declares the cost functions that it supports in the Conformance Declaration resource and in the API definition.

An optional `name` for the route can be provided. The name can be used as the title in links to the route and the name is also included in the route itself.

----
|===

Additional members in the route definition can be ignored.

NOTE: The content model of the route definition object has been designed so that it can also be the content of a process execution request according to the OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core Standard. The motivation for this is the following: The computation of a route is a process that operates on geospatial data that typically includes a routing dataset, which is a networked dataset that has a set of connected vertices and edges that have topological properties on which analysis can be done. This standard specifies the OGC API building blocks for Routes as API resources. An alternate implementation option for a routing API could be to implement routing as a Process resource using the building blocks specified in the OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core Standard. The current design allows that the same request can be sent to both API options to compute a new route. 
The decision to align the payload with OGC API Processes adds additional members "inputs" and "value" that would otherwise be unnecessary.

----
|===

See <<example_cc>> for an example.

NOTE: The plan is to register well-known cost functions with the OGC that are recommended for use, where applicable. Once a register has been established, this Standard will be updated. Until then, use `fastest` for cost functions that optimize duration and `shortest` for cost functions that optimize distance.

The property "preference" in a route definition is a client hint and the server determines how to consider the preference in the computation of the route.  If no preference is specified in the route definition the first value listed in the array is considered the default cost function.

^|A |A successful, synchronous execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a HTTP status code `200`.

NOTE: This requirements class provides no mechanism to change the default, and future extensions could return another route representation, such as an OGC GeoPackage.

^|B |The response SHOULD include a `Content-Language` header with the language used for instructions and names, in particular road/street names, if the language of the text values is known and the same language is used for all text fields in the route.

This requirements class only specifies requirements for the synchronous execution of a routing request. Requirements for the asynchronous execution can be added in a future extension to this Standard.

^|B |If the request is valid, but the server is not able to process the request (e.g., the server has insufficient route network data for the request), a response with status code `422` SHALL be returned.

[[route_definition]]
==== Route definition

[[get_route_definition]]
===== Fetch the definition of a route

This operation returns the input parameters used to create the route with id `routeId`.

[[rc_mode]]
=== Requirements Class "Modes"

Mode is a restriction based on the type of transport desired when computing the route. For instance, "On Road", "Off Road". The API declares the modes that it supports.

See <<example_cc>> for an example.

NOTE: The plan is to register well-known modes with the OGC Naming Authority that are recommended for use, where applicable.

The mode is a client hint and it is the decision of the server how to consider the selected mode in the computation of the route. If no mode is specified in the route definition then the first value listed in the array is considered to be the default mode.
